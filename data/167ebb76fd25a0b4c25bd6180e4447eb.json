It was later established that the child was stabbed 26 times.\"The knife used in this attack is a 12-inch (31cm) serrated military style knife that has a seven-inch blade,\" the Sheriff's office said.The woman, who was seriously injured, is expected to survive the attack.Mr Czuba was found \"sitting upright outside on the ground near the driveway of the residence,\" the statement said.He was taken to hospital for treatment before being questioned by detectives.\"Detectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the ongoing Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis,\" the Sheriff's office added.It has not publicly released the names of the victims.But at a news briefing later on Sunday, from the Chicago office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-Chicago), America's rights group, named the boy as Wadea al-Fayoume, and his mother as Hanaan Shahin.It said Wadea was born in the US, while his mother - originally from Beitunia in the West Bank - came to the country 12 years ago.CAIR-Chicago executive director Ahmed Rehab said Wadea had only celebrated his birthday a few weeks ago.\"He loved his family, his friends. He loved soccer, he loved basketball.\"And he paid the price for the atmosphere of hate and otherisation and dehumanisation that frankly I think we are seeing here in the United States as a result of the irresponsible leadership, lopsided, one-sided statements and coverage that we're seeing in the media, elected officials.\"And we warned about not recreating the same mistake we had in the post 9/11 environment,\" Mr Rehab said, adding that back then innocent members of a particular community had been victimised for the deadly attacks in the US in 2001.More than 1,400 people were killed in Israel last weekend when Hamas fighters crossed the border from the Gaza Strip to attack civilians and soldiers.In Gaza, more than 2,450 people have been killed by Israel's bombing, Palestinian authorities say, with an estimated 1,000 missing under rubble.Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.\u00a9 2023 BBC.
