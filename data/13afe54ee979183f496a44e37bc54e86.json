We are shocked and appalled by the horrific acts of terror in Israel last week. We are also deeply saddened by the intensifying humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza.\"The EU introduced new laws in August 2023 which regulate the kind of content that is allowed online.The Digital Services Act (DSA) requires so-called very large online platforms - those with over 45 million EU users - to proactively remove \"illegal content\", and show they have taken measures to do so if requested.The EU previously told the BBC it was not currently in a position to comment on what would come next in these specific cases, but has explained what was hypothetically possible under the law.The DSA allows the EU to conduct interviews and inspections and, if it is unsatisfied, proceed to a formal investigation.If it decides that a platform has not complied or is not addressing the problems it has identified, and risks harming users, the commission can take steps including issuing fines and as a last resort request judges to ban a platform from the EU temporarily.\u00a9 2023 BBC.
